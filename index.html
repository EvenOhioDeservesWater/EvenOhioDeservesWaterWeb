            <p class="uk-text-lead">East Palestine, Ohio is a village of 4,718 people. Those 4,718 people need help, and can't be forgotten because they live in a village. 
                Not much has been done for them. I alone cannot do much. Please help me. Please join me in trying to do something, even if you feel helpless.</p>
        
            <p>
                If you don't know what happened and is happening in East Palestine, 
                here's a short summary; 
                <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/02/22/east-palestine-ohio-train-derailment-explained/11304391002/">USA Today Article</a>. 
                I'm not an expert and I'm trying to learn more, please share any and all useful information with me at EvenOhioDeservesWater@protonmail.com. That
                being said, some things are clear to me on a base human level. It isn't clear exactly how dangerous this disaster is, or even exactly what can help most.
                But we cannot wait to help before we know for sure. We've seen the disasters that go ignored like Agent Orange or Burn Pits. We cannot wait until we know
                we could have done more. It is infinitely better to try and help as much as possible and hope something sticks, then do nothing until we know we could have
                done something.

            <p>
                Let me be entirely clear. I do not know if this is what East Palestine, Ohio needs most. The EPA currently claims that (aside from private wells), water sources
                are tested and safe; <a href="https://epa.ohio.gov/monitor-pollution/pollution-issues/east-palestine">East Palestine, Ohio EPA Information</a>. However, there 
                seems to be at least some drive and need for safe water donations 
                <a href="https://www.yourerie.com/community/heres-how-you-can-help-east-palestine-ohio-residents/">Erie Restoration, Inc and Modern Industries water drive</a>.
                My desperate hope is to start here, and if at all possible expand. My gut instinct is that clean water, water filtration devices for drinking and showering, 
                uncontaminated food, potentially air filtration devices, and likely some sort of medical aides will be of help here. But I don't know. If you do, please let me know.
            </p>

            <p>
                To get started, lets try to wholesale purchase clean water gallon pallets that can be delivered to this existing drive. It's okay to feel hopeless, I do too, and I don't
                know if this will work. So let's start small, let's try for five pallets. I have eight dollars in my bank account until I'm paid, I spent twelve on this silly website. I'm 
                trying, because anything is better than nothing. Please try with me.
