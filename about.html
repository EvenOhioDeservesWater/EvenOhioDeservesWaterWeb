                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>I'm Liv, a 23yr kinda broke software engineer living in NY. I saw a post about Goya beans being brought as relief for East Palestine.
                        My immediate reaction was to question if beans are actually what's needed, though I do recognize that as a potentially cynical reaction
                        when food stuffs are likely needed. My second reaction was that regardless of if this is what East Palestine needs, it is the most I 
                        have heard is being done for East Palestine. 
                    </p>
                    <p>That realization was frustrating, immediately incredibly sad, and left me feeling helpless and despairing. I think that's a human reaction
                        when met with problems that seem bigger than us. I don't know if I can help, but I immediately thought that it would cost $12 and a couple 
                        hours to throw up a website with a dumb name and try and get some interest in a GoFundMe. "Even Ohio Deserves Water" can sound very derrogatory
                        on the face of it, and insensitive in the current disaster. I thought of the name based on some 
                        <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cant-even-x-in-ohio-only-in-ohio/">dumb memes</a> about Ohio that were popular in the months leading up 
                        to this disaster. My hope and intent is to use this dumb name to capitalize on the viral meme, and raise some money to do some good. Please check
                        out our GoFundMe and donate if you can, or share the effort, or do what you can to help East Palestine even if not related to this effort. Hopefully,
                        we can end up helping with more than water, and make this name even more dumb.
